## What is Multi?

Multi is a decentralized, multi-asset-backed currency where the reserve composition continuously improves through participant competition. Unlike traditional governance models, Multi uses performance-based selection where participants stake capital to propose reserve changes.

## Key Innovation

The system creates natural quality filtering: participants only propose assets they believe will increase in value, as poor proposals result in lost stakes while successful ones earn rewards.
